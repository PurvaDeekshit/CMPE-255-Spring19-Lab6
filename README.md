e. Solution: 

There is a linear relationship with negative slope between age of a driver and driver fatality rate till the data point 64.5, i.e. till 75 years. Till this point, as driver's age (x) increases, the fatality rate (y) decreases. However after this point, i.e. at the last age of 80 years and above, the fatality rate is increases. So, after the second last data point, the relationship is no longer linear.

f. Solution:

To find if the correlation coefficient is significant or not, here, number of data points = n = 6. So, degree of freedom = df = n-2 = 4. For df = 4, critical values are : +0.811 and -0.811. Since correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) = -0.5787437075660629, it lies within the range of two critical values. So the correlation coefficient or Pearson's r is not significant. So, the separating line should not be used for prediction.
